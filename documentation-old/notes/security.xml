<subheading>Users and Roles</subheading>

	<para>The org.nakedobjects.security package provides a number of new classes
		concerned with security.  The most significant of these are User and Role.
		A User represents a specific individual, and will define their user name
		and password.  Each User object can have a number of Role objects 
		associated with it. </para>
		
<subheading>Log-in</subheading>
	
	<para>When a deployed Naked Object system (i.e. a Standalone or ???) is run, the user will be required
		to log-in with a username and password.  (No log-in is required for
		an Exploration, in order to keep the exploration cycle as simple as possible).
	</para>
	
	<para>TBD  -  changing your password</para>
	
<subheading>Default roles:  sysadmin and guest</subheading>

	<para>All deployed systems are provided, by default with two roles:  sysadmin
		and guest, and with two Users of the same name.  [?? How are the passwords
		for sysadmin and guest specified??].  Only the systems administrator
		(sysadmin) can create new Users, new Roles, or assign new Roles to an
		existing User.  The systems administrators may also be given additional
		specific rights or responsibilities by the application.</para>
		
	<para>Guest is a kind of default user role:  all Users automatically have
		the role of 'guest'.  Any anyone can log in as the user 'guest' provided
		they know the password (which is usually quite widely disseminated). Guest
		should therefore be considered as a zero-security role.  Given the 
			<see label="subtractive-control">subractive
		style of control</see> adopted by Naked Objects, any field or action that
		has no form of control specified will be accessible to the guest role. </para>

	<para>Note to Rob:  there should therefore be a way of disabling the
		guest log-in for some systems.</para>
