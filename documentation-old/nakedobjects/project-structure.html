<h1>Project Structure</h1>
<p>Naked Objects is broken up in a number of sub-projects, each of
which
deals with a specific aspect of&nbsp; the framework.&nbsp; The central
project is no-core, and </p>
<h3>Structure of a sub-project</h3>
<p>Each sub project always has a source, test and example directories,
for
the framework code, the unit tests, and usage examples
respectively.&nbsp; If needed there will be directories for library
files, external scripts and executables, documentation, and
notes.&nbsp; In addition, as part of the build a build directory, and
as part of running within eclipse, a classes directory.</p>
<p>The structure of the source and test directorys should be the same
so
that the tests are in a separate, but parallel tree.</p>
<p>Files included in the project directory include the Eclipse project
configuration files, an Ant build configuration, a read me.</p>
<p>The project directory will look as follows (square brackets indicate
optional directories, curly brackets indicate those generated by the
build on the IDE):-</p>
<pre> - [bin]<br> - {build}<br> - {classes}<br> - [doc]<br> - example<br> - [lib]<br> - [notes]<br> - src<br> - test<br> - .classpath<br> - .project<br> - build.xml<br> - README<br></pre>
