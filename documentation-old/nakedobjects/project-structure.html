  <h1>Project Structure</h1>

  <p>Naked Objects is broken up in a number of sub-projects, each
  of which deals with a specific aspect ofÂ  the framework.Â  The
  central project is no-core, and</p>

  <h3>Structure of a sub-project</h3>

  <p>Each sub project always has a source, test and example
  directories, for the framework code, the unit tests, and usage
  examples respectively.Â  If needed there will be directories for
  library files, external scripts and executables, documentation,
  and notes.Â  In addition, as part of the build a build directory,
  and as part of running within eclipse, a classes directory.</p>

  <p>The structure of the source and test directorys should be the
  same so that the tests are in a separate, but parallel tree.</p>

  <p>Files included in the project directory include the Eclipse
  project configuration files, an Ant build configuration, a read
  me.</p>

  <p>The project directory will look as follows (square brackets
  indicate optional directories, curly brackets indicate those
  generated by the build on the IDE):-</p>
  <pre>
 - [bin]<br />
 - {build}<br />
 - {classes}<br />
 - [doc]<br />
 - example<br />
 - [lib]<br />
 - [notes]<br />
 - src<br />
 - test<br />
 - .classpath<br />
 - .project<br />
 - build.xml<br />
 - README<br />
