<h1>Validity</h1>
<p>NakedValue fields can have validity associated with them, which will
check the value entered by the user before persisting it.&nbsp; In the
latest viewer the entry field will change its look to indicate that an
entry is invalid, and once the entry has been corrected, will revert
back to a normal field indicating that the value is valid and has been
persisted.<br>
</p>
A fields validity can be checked by annotating the business object
class and adding a method prefixed with 'valid' to correspond to the
accesor method prefixed with 'get', e.g. getValue and validValue.&nbsp;
The validity method takes a single parameter of type Validity and
return&nbsp; nothing.&nbsp; Like all the methods that can be seen
automatically it must be public.<br>
<br>
The validity of a naked value can be asserted by call the available
methods on the Validity object.&nbsp;&nbsp; These imply or specify a
condition, and give allow a reason to be given to the user if those
conditions are not met.&nbsp; This validity method will then be called
automatically whenever the user changes the associated naked value.<br>
