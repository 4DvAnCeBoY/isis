  <h1>Validity</h1>

  <p>NakedValue fields can have validity associated with them,
  which will check the value entered by the user before persisting
  it.  In the latest viewer the entry field will change its look to
  indicate that an entry is invalid, and once the entry has been
  corrected, will revert back to a normal field indicating that the
  value is valid and has been persisted.</p>

<p>A fields validity
  can be checked by annotating the business object class and adding
  a method prefixed with 'valid' to correspond to the accesor
  method prefixed with 'get', e.g. getValue and validValue.  The
  validity method takes a single parameter of type Validity and
  return  nothing.  Like all the methods that can be seen
  automatically it must be public.</p>
  
<p>
  The validity of a naked value can be asserted by call the
  available methods on the Validity object.   These imply or
  specify a condition, and give allow a reason to be given to the
  user if those conditions are not met.  This validity method will
  then be called automatically whenever the user changes the
  associated naked value.</p>
