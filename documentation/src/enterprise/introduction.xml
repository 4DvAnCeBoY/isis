  <para>The NOF has been designed from the outset to be used within an
  enterprise application architecture. This section describes what you will
  need to do in order to build the NOF into your own existing enterprise
  application architecture, or to create a complete ‘green field’ architecture
  based around the NOF. Whichever approach you are taking, some significant
  systems integration work is needed. Over time it is our expectation that the
  amount of this integration work required will significant reduce as more and
  more open source solutions emerge.</para>
