  <title>Help</title>

  <para>A way of providing help and assistance to the user is provided by the
  NOF through the decoration of the reflection peers (ActionPeer, OneToOnePeer
  and OneToManyPeer) and though an interface to a lookup service.</para>

  <subheading>How it works</subheading>

  <para>The reflection peers <class>ActionHelp</class>,
  <class>OneToOneHelp</class> and <class>OneToManyHelp</class> forward
  requests to the <class>HelpManager</class> (all from the
  <class>org.nakedobjects.object.help</class> package) when compiling
  <class>Hint</class>s. The help manager interface has a single method that
  will initiate a lookup of help information. This information is merged into
  the hint and passed up from the underlying relfection peers. This method
  takes a <class>MemberIdentifier</class> to allow the service to identify
  which method or field information is needed for. The identifier contains the
  class name, member name and array of parameter names for the method to be
  executed, allowing the external system to determine what method is being
  targeted without any reference ti the NOF itself.</para>

  <subheading>Installation</subheading>

  <para>To install help you need to add the reflection decorator
  <class>org.nakedobjects.object.help.HelpPeerFactory </class>to the
  reflection mechanism <comment>describe this when implemented</comment>. This
  factory needs to be set up with a .... via its
  <method>set....Manager</method> method.</para>

  <subheading>Extending this component</subheading>

  <para>To create a help manager you must implement the
  <class>org.nakedobjects.object.help.HelpManager</class> class, which is a
  <class>NakedObjectComponent</class>.</para>
