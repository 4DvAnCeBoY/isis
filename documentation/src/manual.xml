      <title>Preface</title>

      <para>This manual documents the Naked Objects Framework, the development
      of Naked Objects applications, and the development of its associated
      components and tools. The is both a reference guide for application
      developers and for developers of the components. For an introduction to
      Naked Objects and the the ideas behind the framework please refer to the
      book <ital>Naked Objects</ital> (by Richard Pawson and Robert Matthews)
      published by Wiley.</para>

      <para>This manual is currently available as a PDF document, to be viewed
      using Adobe Acrobat, and online via a browser.</para>

      <para>This edition of the manual is intended for use with version 2.0 of
      the Naked Objects framework, which works with version 1.1, and higher,
      of Java and version 1.1 of .Net. The latest framework is available from
      the download's page of the naked objects website <weblink
      address="http://www.nakedobjects.org/downloads"></weblink>.</para>

      <para>I would like to acknowledge the contributions that Dan Haywood has
      made toward the development of the framework, and would like to also
