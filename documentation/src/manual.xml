      <para>This manual documents  the Naked Objects Framework, the development of Naked Objects
      applications, and the development of its associated
      components and tools. The is both a reference guide for application
      developers and for developers of the components. For an introduction to Naked
      Objects and the the ideas behind the framework please refer to the book
      <ital>Naked Objects</ital> (by Richard Pawson and Robert Matthews)
      published by Wiley.</para>

      using Adobe Acrobat, and online via a browser.</para>

      <para>This edition of the manual is intended for use with version 2.0 of
      the Naked Objects framework, which works with version 1.1, and higher,

      <para>Naked Objects is <ital>free software</ital>, this means that
      everyone is free to use, and free to redistribute it on certain
      conditions. Naked Objects is copyrighted software and has restrictions
      placed on its distribution, but as set out by Free Software Foundation
      these are intended to encourage sharing rather than preventing

      <para>The simplest way to get hold of a copy of Naked Objects is to

      from a colleague or friend.</para>

      <para>I would like to acknowledge the contributions that Dan Haywood has made toward the
      development of the framework, and would like to also thank all those at the DSFA and Bearing Point for their questions, comments and 
      suggestions.</para>
