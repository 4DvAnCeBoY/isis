  <title>Repository</title>

  <para><class>NakedObjects</class> is a respository for NOF providing a
  central access point for the <class>Configuration</class>,
  <class>NakedObjectsLoader</class>, and <class>ObjectManager</class> objects
  amongst other things. It is a abstract singleton that expects it concrete
  subclass to store these details. There are a number of implementation within
  the NOF, specifically one for client side use
  (<class>NakedObjectsClient)</class>, which is for use in applications where
  there is one of each component and hence no ssharing. The other main
  implementation is for server use (<class>NakedObjectsByThread</class>),
  which keeps the one instance of each component for each thread in
  use.</para>

  <subheading>Using the Repository</subheading>

  <para>To install a repository instantiate an instance of it, it will act as
  singleton storing a reference to itself.</para>

  <para>To get hold of one of the components held by the repository use the
  static get methods on the <class>NakedObjects</class> class.</para>
