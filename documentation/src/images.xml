  <description>How images are identified and found</description>

  <para>All images must be held in a directory called <path>images</path> in
  the working directory. In the Java version this directory can be part of a
  Jar file that is found on the classpath.</para>

  <para>Images for objects are picked up by class name in the form of
  <path>&lt;ClassName&gt;.&lt;extension</path>&gt; and will be case sensitive
  on Unix/Linux, but case insensitive on Windows. Images for classes are
  picked up as for objects, but with <em>_class</em> appended to the class
  name (<path>&lt;ClassName&gt;_class.&lt;extension&gt;</path>). This can be
  overriden by the reflector, which can pass back a name of an image that has
  to be got from the business object. This provides a mechanism for objects to
  be shown with images of there specification.</para>

  <para><ital>ClassName</ital> is either the short form or the fully qualified
  name, and case can be important depending on the platform.</para>

  <para>Extensions that are currently supported are <path>.gif</path>,
  <path>.jpg</path>, <path>.jpeg</path> and <path>.png</path>.</para>

  <para>When loading images based on class, if no image is found for the
  current class using the above variations then the process is repeated using
  the name (both short and fully qualified) of the class's immediate
  superclass. This process repeats util there are no more superclasses.</para>
