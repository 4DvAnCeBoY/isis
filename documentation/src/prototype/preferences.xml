  <title>How to Change Preferences</title>

  <para>So far all our examples have used the NOF with its default settings.
  The framework is capable of being configured or extended in many different
  ways. Many of these will be covered in the section on using the NOF as a
  platform to deliver an enterprise system. However, there are aspects of the
  framework that you might want to change even during the prototyping stage.
  These include:</para>

  <list>
    <para>Changing preferences on the default user interface</para>

    <para>Selecting an alternative viewing mechanism</para>

    <para>Changing Logging preferences (+ notes about how to use logging
    within your application if you want to)</para>

    <para>Programming preferences </para>
