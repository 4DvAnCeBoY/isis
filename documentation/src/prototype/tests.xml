  <title>How to write tests for Naked Objects application code</title>

  <para>If you are using the NOF purely for the first type of prototyping
  (i.e. to create a ‘sketch’ or ‘prototype’) then testing will play little
  role. For the other two types of prototyping, then, assuming that you are
  following a ‘test-driven’ or other ‘agile’ methodology, you should be
  looking to build testing in from the earliest stages of the project - so
  that by the time you have completed the prototyping you have executable
  tests to cover all aspects of functionality. The NOF provides excellent
  support for test-driven development in the form of its XAT (eXecutable
  Acceptance Test) framework. This section shows you how to write such
  tests.</para>
