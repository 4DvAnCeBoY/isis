  <title>How to Make DOM Capabilities Accessible to External Applications
  (e.g. through Web Services)</title>

  <para>Methods in your domain objects can easily be written to obtain data,
  and/or to delegate part of their execution to an external service. However,
  it might also be desirable to make some of your domain objects and/or their
  methods accessible to external systems (i.e. those not running on the NOF).
  This can be done either at prototyping or at systems integration stage. We
  are addressing it here because it is purely a matter of application coding -
  it does not require any specific knowledge of the NOF as an enterprise
  platform.</para>
