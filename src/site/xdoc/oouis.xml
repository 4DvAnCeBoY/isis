<h3>The 'drag and drop' user interface</h3><img align="left" alt="" class="wrap-left"
    src="images/dnd-ui.png" style="margin:0 20px 20px 0;" /><p>In this
    application, each icon represents a domain
    object. Double-clicking on an object opens a view showing its properties
    and collections contained, many of which will contain references to other
    domain objects. Right-clicking on any object will give the user a pop-up
    menu of actions that they can perform.</p>

<h3>The HTML user
    interface</h3><img align="right" alt="" class="wrap-right"
    src="images/html-ui.png" style="margin:0 0 0 20px;" /><p>This screenshot
    shows the same application being used through a pure HTML user interface.
    The object's properties are on the right, with the action menu on the
    left. This user interface was also created 100% automatically from the 
    same domain object model. The HTML user interface makes
    it easy to customise the look of an application (merely by editing the
    Cascading Style Sheet), and meets the most stringent accessibility
    guidelines, but it is not as 'expressive' as the interface provided by
    Isis' Drag and Drop viewer.  They are both examples, though, of <a

    object-oriented user interfaces</a>.</p>
