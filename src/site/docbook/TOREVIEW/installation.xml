    <title>Installing [[NAME]]</title>

    <para>Like all Java frameworks [[NAME]] is essentially a set of
    classes and other resources that you run your code with. There are a
    number of ways of developing with [[NAME]]: downloading a traditional
    distribution and installing it on your machine; or using Maven to create
    and manage your [[NAME]] projects. Which you choose is a matter of
    preference and familiarity.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <para>To develop or run [[NAME]] applications you need Java version
      1.5 or above installed on your machine.</para>

      <para>To build and run the examples you will also need either <ulink
      url="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</ulink> or <ulink
      url="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</ulink> installed, both available
      from Apache.</para>

      <para>To develop applications you will need a suitable development
      environment. If you have the choice, we recommend using <ulink
      url="www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</ulink>, because there are some specific
      plug-ins available for Eclipse to facilitate developing with [[NAME]]
      Objects. However, [[NAME]] may be used with any IDE, or even just
      the JDK.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Downloading a distribution</title>

      <para>The latest version of the [[NAME]] framework can be
      downloaded from the <ulink url="./downloads.html">downloads
      page</ulink>, which is essentially a set of links to the <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/isis/">[[NAME]]
      Sourceforge project</ulink> as shown below. You may download either the
      Ant release (suffixed with <emphasis>-for-ant</emphasis> ), the Maven
      release (suffixed with <emphasis>-for-maven</emphasis>), the full source
      release (suffixed with <emphasis>-source</emphasis>) if you wish to
      build the framework yourself, or simply a Jar file that bundles in all
      the dependencies but has no documentation or other resources.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Installing a [[NAME]] distribution</title>

      <para>Extract the downloaded file's content into a suitable directory (a
      root directory is created upon extraction so there is no need to create
      a directory in which to install everything).</para>

      <section>
        <title>The <emphasis role="strong">-for-ant</emphasis> binary
        release</title>

        <para>The binary release for Ant provides the following directories
        and files:-</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>a set of jar files making up the [[NAME]] framework,
            and other third party jars required by the framework (in <filename
            class="directory" moreinfo="none">lib/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>one or more demo applications that may be run from the
            command line (in <filename class="directory"
            moreinfo="none">demos/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>one or more example applications that may be edited,
            compiled and run via Ant (in <filename class="directory"
            moreinfo="none">examples/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>documentation (in <filename class="directory"
            moreinfo="none">docs/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>a <filename class="directory"
            moreinfo="none">resource</filename> directory with icon images and
            templates (<filename>resources/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>For more details on developing using Ant, see <ulink
        url="building-with-ant.html">Building Apps with Ant</ulink>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The <emphasis>-for-maven</emphasis> Binary release</title>

        <para>The binary release for Maven contains supporting resources
        (including icons, examples and this documentation) but does not
        include the [[NAME]] or third party libraries themselves however,
        because Maven itself downloads them from the Maven central repository
        when they are needed.</para>

        <para>The distribution contains the following directories and
        files:-</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>one or more example applications that may be edited,
            compiled and run via Maven (in <filename class="directory"
            moreinfo="none">examples/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>documentation (in <filename class="directory"
            moreinfo="none">docs/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>a <filename class="directory"
            moreinfo="none">resource</filename> directory with icon images
            (<filename>resources/</filename>)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Because the Maven distribution does not include the libraries,
        there is no immediately runnable demo. However as indicated above the
        examples are still there and can be built using Maven (or imported
        into an Eclipse or other IDE and built there).</para>

        <para>For more details on developing using Maven, see <ulink
        url="building-with-maven.html">Building Apps with
        Maven</ulink>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Source release</title>

        <para>The source release contains a series of Maven projects for the
        different subcomponents of [[NAME]], it libs, examples and
        documentation. This source can be used, with the templates in the
        distribution directories, to recreate the distributions that are made
        publicly available.</para>

        <para>To install the framework and all its components into your local
        repository, and generate the distribution files use the maven install
        goal with the <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> profile:</para>

        <literallayout>$ cd isis-4.0 
$ mvn clean install -P all 
</literallayout>

        <para>Any missing resources that maven complains about are can be
        installed into the repository by specifying the specific Jar file from
        the lib directory when following the instructions that Maven gives
        you.</para>

        <para>Using the source release Maven will build the same files that
        you would download if you had downloaded a binary version. The
        distribution files (as detailed for the binary release above) are to
        be found within the directory <filename class="directory"
        moreinfo="none">distribution/tarball/target</filename> as shown
        below.</para>

        <literallayout>distribution/
|-- documentation
|-- examples
|-- pom.xml
|-- tarball
|   |-- pom.xml
|   |-- src
|   `-- target
|       |-- archive-tmp
|       |-- <emphasis>isis-4.0-for-ant.tar.gz</emphasis>
|       |-- <emphasis>isis-4.0-for-ant.zip</emphasis>
|       |-- <emphasis>isis-4.0-for-maven.tar.gz</emphasis>
|       |-- <emphasis>isis-4.0-for-maven.zip</emphasis>
|       |-- <emphasis>isis-4.0-source.zip</emphasis>
|       `-- <emphasis>isis-4.0-libs-only-with-dependencies.jar</emphasis>
`-- target</literallayout>

        <para>With the core libraries and plugins build, the final step is to
        install the archetype so that new projects can be created from the
        local archetype, rather then the publicly available one.</para>

        <literallayout>$ cd archetypes/application 
$ mvn clean install</literallayout>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Jar release</title>

        <para>A final option is to use the jar of jars. This is a single jar
        file that contains all the other jars. This allows you simplify your
        projects by simply having that one jar on your classpath. However,
        this leaves you to set up your projects from scratch.</para>

        <para>This release is often useful later, however, when you have
        created an application and wish to distribute your own way.</para>
