    <title>Images</title>

    <para>All images must be held in a directory called <filename
    class="directory" moreinfo="none">images</filename> in the working
    directory, or on the classpath.</para>

    <para>Images for objects are picked up by class name in the form of
    <filename class="directory"
    moreinfo="none">&lt;ClassName&gt;.&lt;extension</filename>&gt; and will be
    case sensitive on Unix/Linux, but case insensitive on Windows.</para>

    <para>The names of the images can be overriden by the reflector, which can
    pass back a name of an image that is found from the domain object. This
    provides a mechanism for objects to be shown with images that they
    themselves specify.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Extensions</emphasis> that are currently supported are
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">.gif</filename>, <filename
    class="directory" moreinfo="none">.png</filename>, <filename
    class="directory" moreinfo="none">.jpg</filename> and <filename
    class="directory" moreinfo="none">.jpeg</filename>.</para>

    <para><emphasis>ClassName</emphasis> is either the short form or the fully
    qualified name of the class, and case can be important depending on the
    platform.</para>

    <para>When loading images based on class, if no image is found for the
    current class using the above variations then the process is repeated
    using the name (both short and fully qualified) of the class's immediate
    superclass. This process repeats until there are no more
    superclasses.</para>

      <title>Images used by the framework</title>

      <para>There are a number of generic images that are used by the
      framework, and that can be changed to create a different look. These
      are:-</para>
