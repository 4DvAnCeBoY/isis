      <title>Compiling and running an example</title>

      <para>The examples directory contains a couple of examples. Here we will
      use the expenses one. After going to the directory we can use Ant to
      compile and run the code.</para>

      <literallayout>$ cd example/expenses
$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml

compile:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/rcm/tmp/install/isis-4.0/examples/expenses/build
