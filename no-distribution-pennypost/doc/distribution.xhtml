    <h1>Naked Object Extensible Distribution Mechanism</h1>

    <h3>Client</h3>

    <p>To set up a distribution mechanism for Naked Objects you need to create
    implementations of the following interfaces, each which represents a type
    of data that needs to be passed between the client and server:-</p>

    <ul>
      <li>AboutData</li>

      <li>ActionType</li>

      <li>ClassReference</li>

      <li>InstanceSet</li>

      <li>ObjectData</li>

      <li>ObjectReference</li>

      <li>ObjectUpdateMessage</li>

      <li>OidData</li>

      <li>ParameterSet</li>

      <li>SecurityToken</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also implement a factory (implementing the RemoteObjectFactory
    interface) to generate each of the above data types.</p>

    <p>Finally the requests from the Naked Objects client need to transfered
    to the server through an implementation of the DistributionInterface
    interface. Each method that is implemented makes use of the above data
    objects so you are in complete control over what kind of data get passed
    over the network. Note that some of the methods throw exceptions, and
    these need to be propogated over the network and rethrown by the client
    when necessary.</p>

    <h3>Server</h3>

    <p>The server must receive the requests from the client and then call the
    corresponding method on the RemoteMechanism object to execute the request
    on the server. Any response, or any thrown exception must be passed back
    to the client.</p>
