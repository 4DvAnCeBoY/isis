These tests are for the example Naked Objects application generated by the nakedobjects-application Maven archetype.

The main tests are prefixed Test*.  Those pages with a Debug* prefix can also be run as tests, but demonstrate fixtures useful for debugging.  The ExampleStorySuite.SetUp and ExampleStorySuite.TearDown pages are not tests, but are automatically included before and after each test in the usual Fitnesse manner.

The tests can be run either from here as a single suite (Suite button on left hand side), or run individually from each page (Test button).
