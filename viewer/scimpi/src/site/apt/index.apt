Scimpi Viewer

  The <scimpi> module provides a webapp viewer that out-of-the-box provides a similar
  interface to that provided by the {{{../html/index.html}HTML}} viewer.
  
  However, unlike the HTML viewer it allows the user interface to be extensively customized. 
  
Customization

  Scimpi works by searching for a specific page to render the domain object, eg <<<Customer.shtml>>>
  to render a <<<Customer>>> object.  If none is found, it always falls back to a generic page, 
  which can render any object.
  
  Customization therefore is accomplished by providing a specific page.  The elements of this
  page can be any of the tags that Scimpi understands. 

Alternatives

  An alternative to Scimpi which offers similar customization though through a different
  means is the {{{../wicket/index.html}Wicket}} viewer.
 
Further Info
