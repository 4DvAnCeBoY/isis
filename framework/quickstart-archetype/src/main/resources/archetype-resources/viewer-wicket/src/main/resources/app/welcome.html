<p class="intro">
This sample webapp was generated by the Isis QuickStart archetype, configured to use Isis' wicket viewer.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
By default the domain objects are persisted using JDO/DataNucleus objectstore, configured to persist to an in-memory HSQL/DB database.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
To change the JDBC connection string, edit <tt>WEB-INF/persistor_datanucleus.properties</tt>.  Also update the <tt>pom.xml</tt> for the appropriate JDBC driver.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
To change the objectstore implementation, edit the <tt>WEB-INF/isis.properties</tt> file.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
The wicket viewer initially is configured using Wicket's 'development' mode, and Isis' authentication and authorization modules are disabled.
For deployment, typically Wicket viewer should be switched to 'deployment' mode, by editing <tt>WEB-INF/web.xml</tt>.  
Isis' authentication and authorization should also be enabled (again, by editing the <tt>WEB-INF/isis.properties</tt> config file).
