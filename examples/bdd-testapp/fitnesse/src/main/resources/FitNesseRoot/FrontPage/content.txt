!3 Before you start
Make sure you have run
  {{{mvn clean install}}} in the claims-fitnesse parent project.  This will put your application plus its dependencies onto the classpath of the !-FitNesse-! testrunner.  You will also need to do this whenever you have changed your application and want to test it through !-FitNesse-!.  For development, you can also  use the Trinidad test runner to test in-process.  This ''won't'' require running mvn install.
