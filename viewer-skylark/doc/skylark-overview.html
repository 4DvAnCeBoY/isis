  <h1>The 'Skylark' Viewer</h1>

  <p>The skylark viewer is a lightweight viewer for rendering Naked
  Objects.Ã‚Â  The entire workspace is series of composite views
  that use builders to create new views, and each view is wrapped
  by decorators to give a view behaviours and visual features.Ã‚Â 
  Each view is created to render a Content object.</p>

  <p>&lt;&gt;ObjectView is the base class for all views that
  display NakedObjects.Ã‚Â  It provides default behaviour for
  dragging and dropping objects onto other objects.Ã‚Â  It provides
  easy access to the content's object (which is held by the
  ObjectContent). The only option added to the menu items is New
  Workspace, which should create a new workspace, within the
  existing workspace, showing the specified object.</p>

  <h3>Content</h3>

  <p>The Content interface links a view to an object within naked
  objects.Ã‚Â  The subclasses of ObjectField represent naked
  objects that are fields of a parent object, and subclasses of
  ActionField represent parameters used when invoking an action
  method.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>Content types for fields:-</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>ValueField - for NakedValue objects identified as a Value
      object</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>OneToOneField - for NakedObject objects identified as a
      OneToOneAssociation object</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>OneToManyField - for NakedObject objects identified as a
      OneToManyAssociation object</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>RootObject is for top-level NakedObjects - placed on the
  desktop/workplace.</p>

  <p>CollectionElement is for NakedObjects that are placed in
  non-field based collection, such as those for instances.</p>

  <p>ActionContent links together and object and an action that can
  be performed on it.</p>

  <p>ParameterContent provide the holders for the parameter for the
  Actions</p>

  <p></p>

  <h3>Changing views</h3>

  <p>When a view has been changed, moved, replaced etc, call
  markDamaged() to cause the view to be redrawn next time drawing
  is taking place.</p>
