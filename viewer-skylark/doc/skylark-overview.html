<h1>The 'Skylark' Viewer</h1>
<p>The skylark viewer is a lightweight viewer for rendering Naked
Objects.&nbsp; The entire workspace is series of composite views that
use builders to create new views, and each view is wrapped by
decorators to give a view behaviours and visual features.&nbsp; Each
view is created to render a Content object.<br>
</p>
<p><>ObjectView is the base class for all views that display
NakedObjects.&nbsp; It provides default behaviour for dragging and
dropping objects onto other objects.&nbsp; It provides easy access to
the content's object (which is held by the ObjectContent). The only
option added to the menu items is New Workspace, which should create a
new workspace, within the existing workspace, showing the specified
object.</><br>
</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The Content interface links a view to an object within naked
objects.&nbsp; The subclasses of AbstractFieldContent represent naked
objects that are fields of a parent object.&nbsp; </p>
<><></></>
<p>Content types for fields:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ValueField - for NakedValue objects identified as a Value object</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OneToOneField - for NakedObject objects identified as a
OneToOneAssociation object</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OneToManyField - for NakedObject objects identified as a
OneToManyAssociation object</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><>RootObject is for top-level NakedObjects - placed on the
desktop/workplace.</></p>
<></>
<p><>CollectionElement is for NakedObjects that are placed in non-field
based collection, such as those for instances.</></p>
<p>ActionContent links together and object and an action that can be
performed on it.<br>
</p>
<p>ParameterContent provide the holders for the parameter for the
Actions<br>
</p>
<h3><>Changing views</><></></h3>
<p><>When a view has been changed, moved, replaced etc, call
markDamaged() to cause the view to be redrawn next time drawing is
taking place.</></p>
