<h2>Resolving Objects</h2>
<p>Naked objects are loaded lazily so that traffic across the network
and
access to the persistent store are both minimized.&nbsp; The problem we
are facing is that although it saves effort by not opening up each and
every object, more network calls are made and more database accesses
take place because the logical amount of data required is normally more
than that provided.<br>
</p>
<p>Objects are resolved when they are acessed via accessor
methods.&nbsp; I.e. if a customer has a getOrder() method then calling
that method to get the order will ensure that the order object is
resolved.<br>
</p>
<p>The process of resolving an object (restoring its persistent state)
is done by the NakedObjectManager, and it in turn uses the
NakedObjectStore.&nbsp; At present the process is prematurely suspended
if the object is already marked as resolved (isResolved() returns true).&nbsp;
When the NakedObjectManager has restored the state of an object it
calls setResolved() to set that object's resolved flag.<br>
</p>

</p>
<p>CAUTION - titles that refer to contained objects will cause objects
to be resolved early.<br>
