  <h2>Resolving Objects</h2>

  <p>Naked objects are loaded lazily so that traffic across the
  network and access to the persistent store are both minimized.Â 
  The problem we are facing is that although it saves effort by not
  opening up each and every object, more network calls are made and
  more database accesses take place because the logical amount of
  data required is normally more than that provided.</p>

  <p>Objects are resolved when they are acessed via accessor
  methods.Â  I.e. if a customer has a getOrder() method then
  calling that method to get the order will ensure that the order
  object is resolved.</p>

  <p>The process of resolving an object (restoring its persistent
  state) is done by the NakedObjectManager, and it in turn uses the
  NakedObjectStore.Â  At present the process is prematurely
  suspended if the object is already marked as resolved
  (isResolved() returns true).Â  When the NakedObjectManager has
  restored the state of an object it calls setResolved() to set
  that object's resolved flag.</p>

  <p>CAUTION - titles that refer to contained objects will cause
  objects to be resolved early.</p>
